                        <h2><b>What is DANTE?</b></h2>
                        <p>
							At its core, DANTE is a <b>first-person shooter</b> coupled with a heavy emphasis on <b>movement</b>, through its <b>Bunny Hopping</b>
							and <b>Grappling</b> mechanics, and playing as fast as possible. The world of DANTE is <b>narratively and mechanically inspired</b>
							by <b>Dante Alighieri's <i>Inferno</i></b> and currently features two playable Rings, <b>Limbo and Lust</b>. DANTE takes
							great inspiration from popular <b>movement-shooters</b> such as <b>Ultrakill</b>, <b>Titanfall</b>, and <b>DOOM</b>.
                        </p>
						<p>
							This project was created with the help of <b>three other developers</b> over the course of <b>three months</b> and utilizes
							the <b>Unity</b> engine. It is currently playable for both <b>Windows</b> and <b>Mac</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During DANTE's development, I was responsible for overall <b>creative direction</b>, <b>production and managing the team</b>, 
                            <b>leading the programming team</b>, <b>designing and creating the movement mechanics and systems</b>, and <b>audio asset mixing and implementation</b>.
                            I also <b>assisted other developers</b> when necessary, <b>created QOL features</b> such as the <b>settings and difficulty menu</b>,
                            and <b>recorded playtests</b>.

                        <h2><b>Movement Systems and Mechanics</b></h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>Character movement</b> is an absolutely critical component of DANTE's fundamental design. Early in development,
                            we decided that the controls needed to be <b>tight and snappy</b> while quickly responding to player input.
                            I created the underlying systems that control the <b>general character movement</b> which was accomplished through
                            an <b>acceleration-based model</b>. This model essentially <b>ramps the magnitude of the player's movement vector up</b>
                            <b>and down</b>, <b>to and from a target magnitude</b> allowing for <b>quick acceleration and deceleration</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We felt as if general movement wasn't attractive enough and wanted to supplement the responsive controls with
                            some kind of <b>skill-based mechanic</b> that was ultimately manifested in the form of <b>Bunny-Hopping</b> (AKA <b>B-Hopping</b>).
                            I created the <b>technical backing for B-Hopping</b> which consisted of increasing the player's speed when <b>they successfully</b>
                            <b>B-Hopped multiple times in a row</b>. After numerous playtests early in development, we found that <b>players seldom engaged</b>
                            <b>with this mechanic</b> and remedied this by providing an <b>increase in outgoing damage</b> correlated to <b>each successfully chained</b>
                            <b>B-Hop</b>. I was responsible for linking successfully chained B-Hops to the Revolver's damage-dealing systems.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            I was also responsible for creating the <b>physics-based Grapple</b>. The development team felt as if this would
                            enchance the overall gameplay by adding an avenue to play beyond the horizontal plane that general movement
                            and B-Hopping adhere to.

                        <h2><b>Production and Creative Direction</b></h2>
                        <p>
                            DANTE's initial creative foundation was influenced by my own personal affinity for <b>movement-shooters</b>
                            and <b>games that allow players to move quickly</b>. Its' <b>narrative</b>, <b>tone</b>, and <b>mechanics</b> 
                            are inspired by my own read-through of <b>Dante Alighieri's <i>Inferno</i></b>. I felt as if combining these two 
                            sources would result in an <b>action-packed</b> and <b>adrenaline-fueled experience</b> that challenges even the 
                            best players. I pitched DANTE to fellow students during the capstone courses of <b>my undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I handled all <b>production related duties</b> that ranged from <b>managing and creating tasks</b>,
                            <b>recording player feedback</b>, <b>running meetings</b>, <b>submitting required material to teaching staff</b>, 
                            <b>creating design documents</b>, <b>etc</b>. The team felt as if the amount of work necessary for these tasks would be too
                            spread out amongst all team members so I willingly took on the role of <b>producer</b>. This was an <b>absolutely</b>
                            <b>great experience</b> as I learned that <b>so much more</b> goes into a product than just the programming, art, or
                            sound. I learned that the role of a producer <b>is incredibly valuable in maintaining an achieveable workflow </b>
                            for all members of the team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The team made heavy use of <b>Trello</b> for <b>creating</b>, <b>managing</b>, and <b>visualizing tasks</b> related to 
                            each sprint. We found that its ease of use in <b>labeling and naming tasks</b> brought an <b>immense amount of clarity</b> 
                            to what tasks were more urgent than others. The team also made use of <b>Google Drive and Docs</b> as a centralized space 
                            for <b>valuable resources</b>, <b>assets</b>, <b>production related documents</b>, and <b>deployments</b>.
